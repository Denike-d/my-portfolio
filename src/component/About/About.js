                My name is Adenike Ogunmodede, a Frontend Developer. I enjoy
                designing products that are both attractive and effective and
                offer satisfying user experiences.
                <br />
                <br />
                I previously worked at Reimnet, a Software Engineering company.
                While at Reimnet, I worked on a number of interesting projects.
                One of the projects I worked on, was a software application that
                manages the facilities of a Real Estate. The application allows
                users to request for service providers, receive quotations from
                service providers and also track the availability of a service
                provider. I built the project with two other developers using
                React js and Tailwind Css.
                <br />
                <br />
                Aside from being a Frontend Developer, I engage in tech
                community activities. Iâ€™m a volunteer in some tech community
                groups in my country.
